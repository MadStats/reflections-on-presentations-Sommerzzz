# reflections-on-presentations

For each presentation, copy-and-paste then fill-in-the-blanks.  You must comment on at least one thing. 



Title of presentation: Fragile Families

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: clearly defined and fruitful predictor variables which are seemed to be really useful.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: deal with survey data, since the grit value is self-reported, is it too subjective and how can you believe it.





Title of presentation: Mass Shooting

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Very intuitive and problem-oriented. The EDA plots are excellent.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: Since it is mentioned that the some of the predictor variables and the response variable may be correlated with time, are they really correlated or just because they are both correlated with time? Why not plug in a time predictor?





Title of presentation: Voting

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: Clearly explained procedure and the advantages and disadvantages of the model.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: Why the prediction is much better in true positive than false negative? How does the model fit on the training data?





Title of presentation: Yelp

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: I like the example in LDA, it helps me better understand how they are dealing with the text.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: Confused about how they deal with the insignificant variables in the loess regression.





Title of presentation: Crime

What were aspects of the presentation that you liked: The EDA is interesting and reasonable.

What were aspects of the presentations for which you had concerns or questions: I expect more explanation about the comparison of different models. And I am a little bit confused about the devision of the blocks.
